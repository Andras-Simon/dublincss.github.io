We are very excited to announce that on our October's meeting we'll host a Hacktoberfest event!

### What's Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software, sponsored by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small â€” bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe!

### Rules and prizes

First, sign up on the Hacktoberfest site at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make 4 pull requests between October 1-31. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

Connect with other Hacktoberfest participants by using [#hacktoberfest](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hacktoberfest) on your social media platform of choice.

## The Talk

Don't like hands on activity or not interested in hacking Open Source? We'll have a talk first so we can relax while learning a new thing ðŸ˜Š

### Back to the Future: Modern CSS without Tech Debt - [Otto Sichert](https://github.com/ottosichert)

Have you ever worked on a project and found yourself wrestling with outdated innovations and over-complicated tools? Would you like to have a talk with the engineer at that time (maybe yourself!) and explain what would have saved you a lot of headaches nowadays?

Then here you are just in time before the Next Big Thing (tm) arrives at your local timezone! See how you can write modern CSS and reverse tech debt into graceful End Of Life (EOL).

Your future you approves.

**Otto** is an enthusiastic engineer with a Python background, an ECMAScript present and PM future who is excited about work environments where you feel like home. Enjoys dub techno, biking and yoga but not always at the same time.

### Quick introduction to Hacktoberfest - [DublinCSS Organizers](https://meetup.com/DublinCSS)
